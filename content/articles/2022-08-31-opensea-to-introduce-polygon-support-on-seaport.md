OpenSea, the number one NFT marketplace, announced today that it will begin using Seaport for all new listings and offers on Polygon, openSea tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today, we will begin using Seaport for all new listings and offers on Polygon! We’re excited to start using Seaport across multiple blockchains to improve the experience for everyone on OpenSea.<br><br>Here’s what you can expect with this move to Seaport ↯</p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1564717997842845696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



In June, Open introduced [Seaport](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/launching-seaport-saving-the-community-millions-in-fees/), a brand new, open-source, web3 marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs. 

Opensea is trying to lower the cost to use its web3 marketplaces, this change will help users to avoid Ethererum gas fees.

According to a post on the [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/polygon-on-seaport/) website: "After several months of observing Seaport’s impact and collecting valuable feedback, we’re excited to introduce Polygon support on Seaport. In the coming months, we will be adding support for Klaytn and other EVM-compatible chains as well.

Previously, Polygon on OpenSea was powered by the 0x protocol. And now, by moving Polygon over to Seaport, we’re consolidating our infrastructure to provide a more stable buying and selling experience that matches other chains. The move will also allow us to ship new features across all EVM-compatible chains faster."

Opensea has also launched several new features that will make the buying and selling experience with Polygon even better: Here’s what you can expect:

* Native token support


* No listing thresholds


* Multiple creator fees


* Collection & attribute offers


* English and Dutch auctions


* List as bundles


* Purchasing for another wallet


* Bulk Transfers

As part of the shift to Seaport, OpenSea now supports using MATIC, Polygon’s native token, as a payment option. Anyone transacting on Polygon using OpenSea will now be required to pay for their own gas fees for transacting using MATIC.
