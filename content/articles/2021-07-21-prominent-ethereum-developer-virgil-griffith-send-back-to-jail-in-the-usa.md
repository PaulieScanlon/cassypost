Virgil Griffith Ethereum Foundation researcher is charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Federal authorities believe he assisted North Korea's efforts to launder money using cryptocurrency to avoid U.S. sanctions after he attended a blockchain conference in Pyongyang in April 2019.

He was initially denied bail but was finally granted a bond order for \$1 million at the end of December 2019.

Prosecutors sought to revoke Griffith's bail, claiming he violated bail terms that sharply restrict his internet use.  he allegedly tried to access his cryptocurrency account on Coinbase by a third party his mother. He had been granted bail on condition that he not access his accounts and remain under house arrest with his parents in Alabama.

Virgil Griffith may likely spend the next few months in jail. He is scheduled to be tried on September 21 on charges of conspiracy to violate sanctions with North Korea and If found guilty of the conspiracy charges, he faces up to 20 years in prison.
