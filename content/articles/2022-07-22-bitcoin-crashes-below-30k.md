According to data aggregator, Glassnode's July 19 “The Week On-Chain”[ report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-on-chain-week-29-2021/),  On-chain activity (volume and entities) remains significantly down from the highs. Utilization of the Bitcoin network for value transfer suggests low demand.

In the limelight this week will be the performance of the Grayscale GBTC product with around 31.9k GBTC shares unlocking through the remainder of July.

The GBTC market price continued to trade at a notable discount last week, ranging between -11.0% and down to -15.3%. Whilst the discount has recovered from the absolute lows of -21.3% to NAV, any significant and persistent discount suggests lacklustre demand, and can also attract capital away from spot BTC markets.

Meanwhile, miners are also demonstrating extreme resilience and desire to accumulate, despite the extraordinary costs incurred as the Great Migration carries on. It is possible that additional sell-side pressure from offline distressed miners is being more than offset by the extraordinary profitability by remaining operational miners.
