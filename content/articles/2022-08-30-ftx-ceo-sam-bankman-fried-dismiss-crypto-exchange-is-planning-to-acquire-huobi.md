<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just to be explicit because apparently a lot of people are saying this:<br><br>No, we are not planning to acquire Huobi.</p>&mdash; SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1564263100597010438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

FTX bought Japanese exchange Liquid and also agreed to [acquire Canadian trading platform Bitvo](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/17/ftx-agrees-to-acquire-canadian-trading-platform-bitvo-as-it-eyes-regional-expansion/) in June this year.

FTX also offered to acquire bankrupt lender [Voyager](https://blockworks.co/ftx-offers-to-bail-out-voyager/) and [BlockFi](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ftx-could-buy-blockfi-for-only-2415m-e2-80-93-or-a-lot-more-if-crypto-lender-hits-big-goals/ar-AA10WKgJ) some months ago.
